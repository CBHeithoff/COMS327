This C program generates a word search puzzle by placing given words into a grid of user-defined size. To insert words, the program randomly selects a position and direction (diagonal up, rightward, diagonal down, and downward). Words cannot overlap. Once all words are placed, the remaining empty spaces in the grid are filled with random letters to complete the puzzle.

Using rand() functions ensures that each puzzle generated is unique. First, a random direction, row, and column are generated for the initial position. If that position does not fit, the program will try the other three directions. If no direction is suitable at that spot, the program will check every direction on each position in the row. If no position is suitable in that row, the program will check every direction on each row position for each column. This search covers every possible position for the word. The program will exit if no position is found and output an error message.
