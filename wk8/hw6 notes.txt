C to C++

    change .c to .cpp
    use g++
    C allows imexplicit casts, C++ doesn't
    a few hours
    look at output of compiler error, it will tell how to cast stuff

Fog of War

    haven't seen it, don't know it
    can only see light radius and previously seen stuff
    could make it to see entire rooms when in rooms
        or change light radius
    can see monster in light radius, but cannot see monsters in previously seen dungeon far away
    updates (by tunnelers) in previously seen dungeon spaces are not updated until seen again
    implementation
        explored flag dungeon map
        use a message queue to print when you want to print
