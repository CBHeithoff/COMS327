// dice roll simulator

// RSA

// public key and private key
// give public key to everyone, they encript their message/data with it
// then only you know how to decript it with private key
// can send signed message with encripting your own stuff with private key (?)
// others can decript with public key (?)

// RSA involves factorizing prime numbers

// works since factoring large numbers is mp complete
    // testing solution is easy in linear time
    // finding solution is exponential (need to test all possible solutions)
// p = mp problem
    // if p = mp then RSA is cooked

// RSA
// needs random number generator
    // don't seed random numbers with time of day
