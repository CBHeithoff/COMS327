// functions from Steven

// read() is lowest level of reading files
// read() can inexplicitly fail 
    // OS stops to process something with higher priority
// loop of read() to ensure completion, like readn()
    // only fail if unrecoverable


// write() is same as read() with a writen() function

// readline() is readn() but stops at a new line
