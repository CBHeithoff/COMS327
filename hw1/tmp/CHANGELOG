1/30/2025 6:00 pm:  Created a .h, .c, and main.c file for dungeon generation.
                    Defined a dungeon struct, dungeon cell struct, and room struct each with their needed data (sizes, types, etc.) in the .h file.
                    Defined functions to initialize an empty dungeon, generate rooms in a dungeon, and print out a dungeon to the terminal in the .h file.
                    Started and completed the dungeon initialization function to set the dungeon immutable boundary and all cells to rocks.
                    Started and Completed the dungeon print out function to print a given dungeon to the terminal.

1/30/2025 11:00 pm: Started and completed the dungeon room generation function to randomly create 7-10, non-overlapping rooms that are between 4-15 units in the x direction and 3-9 units in the y direction.

1/31/2025 2:00 pm:  Started and completed a simple corridor generation function to connect all rooms.
                    Added randomness to the corridor generation function so corridors are not straight lines, but curve instead.

2/3/2025 10:00 am:  Started and completed a function to randomly place between 2-3 staircases in a dungeon.

2/3/2025 4:00 pm:   Added some documenation and finished the README description.

2/4/2025 5:00 pm:   Changed up the Makefile to follow the example in lecture before submission.
