This project in C is a dungeon generator. The file dungeon_gen.h includes all needed C libraries and defines certain limits (dungeon size, room size, and # of rooms). This .h file defines individual dungeon cell data (type, char, and size) in a dungeon_cell struct, room data (size and position) in a room struct, and dungeon data (cell table and room array) in a dungeon struct. The .h also defines the functions dungeon_init, dungeon_room_gen, dungeon_corridor_gen, dungeon_stair_gen, and dungeon_print developed in the dungeon_gen.c file.

Dungeon_init initializes the dungeon's rocks and immutable boundary. Dungeon_room_gen creates 6-9 randomly placed/sized and non-overlapping rooms that ahere to the size requirements. Dungeon_corridor_gen connects all rooms (by closeness in proximity) with corridors that have the randomness to curve to their destination. Additionally, one extra corridor is placed between two random rooms to create a loop within the dungeon map for realism. Dungeon_stair_gen randomly places 2-3 staircases (at least one upward and one downward) in either rooms or corridors. Lastly, in the dungeon_gen.c file is dungeon_print which prints a dungeon to the terminal. 

Additionally, there is dungeon_gen_main.c, which instantiates a dungeon and runs the needed functions to output a generated dungeon to the terminal. The Makefile compiles and runs the program. A CHANGELOG shows the dates/times I worked on parts of the project.
