1/30/2025 6:00 pm:  Started assignment 1
                    Created a .h, .c, and main.c file for dungeon generation.
                    Defined a dungeon struct, dungeon cell struct, and room struct each with their needed data (sizes, types, etc.) in the .h file.
                    Defined functions to initialize an empty dungeon, generate rooms in a dungeon, and print out a dungeon to the terminal in the .h file.
                    Started and completed the dungeon initialization function to set the dungeon immutable boundary and all cells to rocks.
                    Started and Completed the dungeon print out function to print a given dungeon to the terminal.

1/30/2025 11:00 pm: Started and completed the dungeon room generation function to randomly create 7-10, non-overlapping rooms that are between 4-15 units in the x direction and 3-9 units in the y direction.

1/31/2025 2:00 pm:  Started and completed a simple corridor generation function to connect all rooms.
                    Added randomness to the corridor generation function so corridors are not straight lines, but curve instead.

2/3/2025 10:00 am:  Started and completed a function to randomly place between 2-3 staircases in a dungeon.

2/3/2025 4:00 pm:   Added some documenation and finished the README description.

2/4/2025 5:00 pm:   Changed up the Makefile to follow the example in lecture before submission.



2/10/25 12:30 PM:   Started assignment 2
                    Started hw2 by downloading the post-hw1 code the professor sent out.
                    Created a load_dungeon function that opened a file at the correct path.
                    Added implementation to set the hardness and place the rooms.

2/11/25 5:00 PM:    Added implementation in the load_dungeon function to staircases, walls/rocks, and the PC '@'.
                    Tested the load_dungeon function on all the given dungeon saves and all passed.

2/11/25 8:00 PM:    Created a save_dungeon function to write the file-type marker, version marker, and file size.
                    Implementated the dynamically sized array to keep track of the rooms.

2/11/25 11:00 PM:   Added implementation in save_dungeon to write pc position, cell hardness, # of rooms, position of rooms.
                    Added save_dungeon to write up and down staircases.
                    Tested using both --save and --load, found bug with loop index in save_dungeon.
                    first version of --save and --load are working.

2/12/25 2:00 PM:    Fixed an issue with a seed not being generated when using --save option.
                    Combined CHANGELOG for hw1 and hw2 to align with sylabus instructions.
                    Added error handling for if a file isn't opened correctly or a fread/fwrite fails.
                    Created the README description for hw2.
                    Fixed a bug with dungeon not saving when trying to save dungeon with a specific seed.

2/12/25 5:30 PM:    Cleaned and packaged directory for submission.
