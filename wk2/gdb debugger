Debug command: 
    gdb <binary_file> 
        good for program crashes
    run - to run
    print <variable>
    bt - backtrack to see values before the crash
        probably crash in library, move up to your code
    up/down - move through stack track
    start - run with breakpoint at main
    continue/(s)tep/(n)ext - step goes inside function calls one line at a time
    break queue_enqueue <function>
    print *<struct> - see data in struct
    list - list function list maybe

Debug command:
    valgrind ./<executable>
        good for unseen bugs
    runs program in sandbox
    can find memory leaks
    say yes if valgrind says to run another command, more info
    valgrind --leak-check=full --show-leak-kinds=all --track-origins=yes --logfile=<file_name> ./<executable>
